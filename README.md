This research focuses on lithium-ion battery SOH estimation. The source data is not included in this repository due to its large size.

The University of Maryland dataset selected the CS2 battery dataset, and its raw data can be obtained from https://cacle.umd.edu/battery-data.  

The Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University data selected the first three batches of lithium-ion battery data, and the source data can be accessed at https://zenodo.org/records/10963339.  

The Huazhong University of Science and Technology data included eight lithium-ion batteries, and the original data can be downloaded from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/nsc7hnsg4s/2.  

The University of Oxford lithium-ion battery dataset used its aging battery data, and the source data is available at https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:03ba4b01-cfed-46d3-9b1a-7d4a7bdf6fac.

The data processing method of the model follows the approach described in the paper. You can perform data preprocessing using custom feature values (the default in this study is ten features). You may modify the model features and apply the model from this study.
